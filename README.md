Note from Quan Bach:
The following is the list of QB's implementation for each project:

-project 2: 
            Highest priority first with preemptive scheduler          (HPFpreemptive.hpp, HPFpreemptive.cpp) 
            Round robin scheduler                                     (roundRobin.hpp, roundRobin.cpp)

-project 3:
            Multi-threads seller implemented with p-thread            (multithreads_seller.hpp, multithreadsseller.cpp)

-project 4:
            Least frequentlty used swapping algorithm                 (LFU.hpp, LFU.cpp)
            Most frequently used swapping algorithm                   (MFUfromLFU.hpp, MFUfromLFU.cpp)
-project 5:
            Compute & trace movement of read/write head based on different disk scheduling algorithms
     
-project 6:
            program to demonstrate pipe() and select()                 (main.cpp*)
            *this is a collaborative effort program.
